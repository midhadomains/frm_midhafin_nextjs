                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It might seem obvious that firms should manage financial risk. However, it is not that simple in
                        the
                        corporate world. Specifically, a firm must answer several questions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Does managing risk make sense from the perspective of the firm’s owners?</li>
                            <li>What is the precise purpose of a risk management strategy?</li>
                            <li>How much risk should the firm retain? What risks should be managed? What instruments and
                                strategies should be applied? The wrong answers can turn risk management itself into a
                                major
                                threat to the firm.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a potent mix of need and opportunity for risk management in modern firms:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Need:</strong> The need to manage financial risk grew significantly from the
                                1970s
                                as markets liberalized (e.g., commodities, interest rates, and foreign exchange), price
                                volatility shot up, and the global economy gathered steam.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> The growth in market volatility helped spawn a
                                fast-evolving
                                selection of financial risk management instruments in the 1980s and 1990s, giving firms
                                many
                                more opportunities to manage their risk profiles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>RISKS FROM USING RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk management instruments allow firms to hedge economic exposures, but they can also have
                        unintended negative consequences. They can quickly change a firm’s entire risk profile (i.e.,
                        within
                        days or hours) in ways that can either reduce risk or build a speculative position. Furthermore,
                        this change may not be immediately apparent.</li>
                    <li>For example, a firm with an exposure to a variable interest rate might use a complicated
                        instrument
                        that dampens this exposure, provided that interest rates stay within certain bounds. But the
                        same
                        instrument might increase the firm’s financial exposure if interest rates break through a given
                        ceiling. Is this risk management, or a bet?</li>
                    <li>Modern corporations can potentially have risk profiles traditionally associated with investment
                        banks. All that is needed is a computer, the right passwords, and (hopefully) the permission of
                        the
                        board. The growing resources devoted to corporate risk management exist partly to ensure these
                        new
                        corporate capabilities are used wisely.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>HEDGING RISK EXPOSURES – DISADVANTAGES (Theoretically)</h4>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Just because risk can be hedged does not mean that it should be hedged. Hedging is
                                simply a
                                tool and, like any tool, it has limitations.</li>
                            <li>The M&M analysis showed that the value of a firm cannot be enhanced only by the means of
                                financial transactions, under the assumption of perfect capital markets.</li>
                            <li>The CAPM established that under perfect capital markets, firms should not be concerned
                                with
                                idiosyncratic or unsystematic risks and should make investment decisions only based on
                                the
                                common risks shared by other companies as well because these unsystematic risks can be
                                diversified.</li>

                    <li>Hedging is a zero-sum game that has no long-term benefits on the firms’ earnings or cash flows.
                    </li>
                    <li>Active hedging may distract the management from its core business.</li>
                    <li>Management might lack the specialized skills required for hedging.</li>
                    <li>An unsound hedging technique can result in losses.</li>
                    <li>Every hedging strategy has compliance costs. Hedging also has costs that are both transparent
                        (e.g.,
                        an option premium) and opaque (e.g., the dangers arising from tactical errors and rogue
                        trading).
                    </li>
                    <li>Hedging via derivatives can reveal protected confidential information.</li>
                    <li>Hedging can increase volatility due to the gap between accounting earnings and economic cash
                        flows.
                    </li>
                    <li>Equity investors will not want managers to hedge their risk if the investor holds the investment
                        as
                        part of a diversified portfolio.</li>

                <h4>HEDGING RISK EXPOSURES – ADVANTAGES (Theoretically)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In reality, capital markets are not perfect.</li>
                    <li>Hedging can lower the cost of capital for a firm.</li>
                    <li>Reduced volatility indicates good management.</li>
                    <li>Hedging can bring about operational improvements.</li>
                    <li>Hedging via derivatives can be cheaper than insurance.</li>
                    <li>Hedging can lead to taxation benefits in various ways. Hedging can have the effect of increasing
                        after-tax revenues.</li>
                    <li>Equity investors may want managers to hedge their risk if the investor has concentrated their
                        investment in a specific firm, (e.g., a family-owned firm or even a state-owned firm).</li>

                <h4>RISK APPETITE</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk appetite describes the amount and types of risk a firm is willing to accept. This is in
                        contrast to risk capacity, which describes the maximum amount of risk a firm can absorb.</li>
                    <li>In practical terms, risk appetite is two things:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A statement about the firm’s willingness to take risks in pursuit of its business goals.
                                The
                                detailed risk appetite statement is usually an internal document that is subject to
                                board
                                approval. However, compact versions can appear in some annual corporate reports.</li>
                            <li>The sum of the mechanisms linking this top-level statement to the firm’s day-to-day risk
                                management operations. These mechanisms include the firm’s detailed risk policy,
                                business-specific risk statements, and the framework of limits for key risk areas. The
                                operational expression of the risk appetite statement should also be approved by the
                                board
                                and needs to be congruent with a wider set of risk-related signals that the firm sends
                                to
                                its staff (e.g., incentive compensation schemes).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>A key issue concerns the consistency of risk appetite across risk types. Generally, firms regard
                        themselves as more or less “conservative” or “entrepreneurial” in their attitude toward risk.
                        However, this characterization should logically depend on the type of risk, and on the firm’s
                        risk
                        management expertise. For example, a high-tech firm might decide to adopt a very high-risk
                        strategic
                        objective in the belief that this is within its expertise. It might even believe that it will
                        lose
                        its purpose entirely if it does not outpace competitors. Here, taking a bet is risk management.
                        However, the same firm could logically take a very conservative view of how it manages its
                        foreign
                        exchange exposures. Furthermore, it may already be managing some risks (e.g., cyber risk) much
                        more
                        explicitly and adeptly than the conservative blue-chip firm across the road.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a trend toward making corporate risk appetites more explicit, both in terms of the
                        kinds of
                        risks deemed acceptable and in terms of forging a link to quantitative risk metrics. Generally,
                        as
                        shown in the figure, the risk appetite is set well below the firm’s total risk-bearing capacity,
                        and
                        above the amount of risk the firm is exposed to currently (labeled here as the firm’s risk
                        profile).
                        The dotted lines are upper and lower trigger points for reporting purposes. These are designed
                        to
                        let the board know if risk taking looks unnaturally low or if there is a danger of breaching the
                        agreed risk appetite. Risk appetite is therefore part of a firm’s wider identity and
                        capabilities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <figure><img
                        src="https://i0.wp.com/home.midhafin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Risk-appetite.png?resize=725%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"
                        alt="" /></figure>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>In truth, forging a robust link between top-of-house risk appetite statements and the operational
                    metrics of risk appetite in a particular risk type or business line is a challenging task. As seen
                    in
                    the previous chapter, there is no single measure of risk, even within a single risk type, that
                    allows us
                    to monitor risk at the business level and then easily aggregate this to the enterprise level. The
                    result
                    is that firms operationalize their risk appetite using a multiplicity of measures. For financial
                    firms,
                    this can include business and risk-specific notional limits, estimates of unexpected loss, versions
                    of
                    value-at-risk (VaR), and stress testing. The level of detail needs to reflect the nature of the risk
                    and
                    the sophistication of the risk management strategy.</li>
