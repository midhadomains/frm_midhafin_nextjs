      data: "While Part 1 leans towards a foundational and numerical focus, Part 2 takes a turn by placing a greater emphasis on theoretical aspects. What’s intriguing is that, despite the theoretical nature, these aspects in Part 2 are more industry-oriented and practical, offering a unique blend that challenges candidates to apply their theoretical understanding in real-world contexts.Part 2 requires candidates to integrate knowledge from different subjects and apply them in a holistic manner. For instance, questions may necessitate blending concepts from market, credit, and operational risk to provide comprehensive solutions.",

              FRM Part 2 is the second level of the Financial Risk Manager (FRM)
              examination, offered by the Global Association of Risk
              Professionals (GARP). This segment of the FRM certification delves
              into practical applications of the knowledge acquired in FRM Part
              1. It offers a more in-depth exploration of key areas, including
              market risk, credit risk, operational, liquidity risk, risk
              management in investment, and a study of current issues in the
              financial markets. There are portions which primarily focus on
              applying the knowledge and concepts acquired in Part 1, and hence
              it is assumed that candidates already possess a foundational
              understanding of the concepts covered in Part 1. But there are
              certain areas of Part 2 that introduce entirely new or more
              advanced concepts that candidates may not have encountered in Part
              1. This signifies that Part 2 combines both the application of
              existing knowledge from Part 1 and the introduction of fresh,
              potentially challenging material.
